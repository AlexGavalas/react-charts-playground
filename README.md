- [X] [AM Charts](https://amcharts.com/) ðŸ‘Ž  
  Too complicated API when used in React.
- [X] [VisX](https://airbnb.io/visx/)
- [X] [Chart.js](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2)
- [X] [D3](https://d3js.org/)  
  VisX seems a simpler way to use D3 in React.
- [X] [Apache Echarts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html)  
  Very nice. ðŸš€ Does not have a React library, but seems quite easily integratable.
- [X] [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/)  
  Not the best types. Working but may require some manual typing. Seems oriented to more scientific charts.
